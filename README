Almond
======

Almond is an all purpose digital housekeeper.

That basically means it will apply a set of rules to a set of files, and then
perform a number of actions. These might be actions to archive or delete old
files, sort images into folders based on download date, or something entirely
different. The rules and and actions are written in the common script language
Lua, and is easily user extensible.

Almond is licensed under GPLv3, with all that that entails. See the LICENSE
file for details.
